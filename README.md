# Optimization Project 2

This project was done to fulfill the project 2 requirements for the course CISC 820 - Quantitative Foundations.


In this project, we experiment with different optimization methods on the given functions. The three optimization methods and one additional method are:
1. Gradient Descent
2. Newton's Method
3. Quasi Newton Method
4. Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) (Optional)

## Reproducing the Project

To reproduce this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/imageadhikari/Optimization_Project2.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
   cd Optimization_Project2
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    For Windows:

    python -m venv my_env 
    my_env\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

    ```bash
    For Linux:

    python3 -m venv my_env
    source my_env/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install the required libraries
